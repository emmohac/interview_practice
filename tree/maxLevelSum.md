# Maximum Level Sum of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.

Return the smallest level X such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level X is maximal.

Example:

```
root:
        1
      /   \
     7     0
   /   \
  7    -8

result: 2
Explanation: sum of every node at level is maximum
```
