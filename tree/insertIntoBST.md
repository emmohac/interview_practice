# Insert Into a Binary Search Tree  
Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to be inserted into the tree, insert the value into the BST. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.  

Example:
```
root:
        4
      /   \
     2     7
   /
  1
value to insert: 5
result:
        4
      /   \
     2     7
   /     /
  1     5
```
