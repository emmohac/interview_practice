# Odd Even Linked List  

Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes.  
Note: group the node, not the value of the node.  
Constraints:
- The first node is odd, second node is even and so on.  
- The relative order should not change.  

Example:
```
head: 1->2->3->4->5
result: 1->3->5->2->4  

head: 1->2->3->4
result: 1->3->2->4
```
